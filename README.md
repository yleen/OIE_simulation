# Simulation code for ''Optional intervals event''

**The paper in Arxiv has now been updated to v4, where OIE is defined as a 4-tuple structure. We are currently updating the implementation of this code and will submit it as soon as possible.**

The "Optional Intervals Event" is a newly introduced concept in theoretical research (as seen in arXiv:2504.09471 [math.GM]). It involves defining events within specific, customizable time intervals and establishing formal logical operations (like "complete sequential addition/multiplication") to structure these intervals. The framework aims to model event ordering abstractly
