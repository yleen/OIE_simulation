# Simulation code for ''Optional intervals event''

The "Optional Intervals Event" is a newly introduced concept in theoretical research (as seen in arXiv:2504.09471v2 [math.GM]). It involves defining events within specific, customizable time intervals and establishing formal logical operations (like "complete sequential addition/multiplication") to structure these intervals. The framework aims to model event ordering abstractly
